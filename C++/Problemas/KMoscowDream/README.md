# Moscow Dream 

https://open.kattis.com/problems/moscowdream

For many students, getting a ticket to The ICPC World Finals is a huge achievement, and *The 2019 ICPC Asia Danang Regional Contest* is a chance to make their dream come true. For some others, they just like to stretch their brains and solve interesting problems. 

We - *the scientific comittee* understand that, and we tried our best to setup a problemset that is interesting and diverse in both topics and difficulty. For a few months, we called for a problem proposals from many people and received $a$ easy problems, $b$ medium problems and $c$ hard problems. Using these proposals, we want to create a problemset which: 

- Consists of exactly $n$ problems. 
- Has at least 1 easy problem. 
- Has at least 1 medium problem. 
- Has at least 1 hard problem. 

Your tast input contains 4 integers $a$, $b$, $c$ and $n$ ($0 \leq a, b, c, \leq 10, 1 \leq n \leq 20$). 


## Output 

Print 'YES' if it is possible to create a problemset satisfaying above requirements, and 'NO' otherwise. 

## Explanation of sample data 

- In the first sample, the committee do not have any easy problem. Thus, they canno create a problemset with at least 1 easy problem. 
- In the second sample, the committee can use 3 easy problems, 7 medium problems and 3 hard problems to create a problemset with exactly 13 problems.
